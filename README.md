# learning flask / three.js
 The purpose of this project is to learn Flask, React, and Three.js, but it is in its infancy at the moment.
 There is no concrete plan, only a vague direction that I want to flesh out as I learn more.
 Currently it is just a sandbox of sorts but as I learn more it will become an actual project
 
 
 js is under static/js/threejstest.js
 
 html file is under templates/threejstest.html
